# 4 ADDING OR DELETING MATRIX ROWS AND COLUMNS
# NOTE : Technically, matrices are of fixed length and dimensions, so we cannot add or delete rows or columns. However, matrices can be reassigned, and thus we can achieve the same effect as if we had directly done additions or deletions.
# 3.1 CHANGING SIZE OF MATRIX
# NOTE : Reassignment occurs even when you don’t see it. For instance, even the innocuous-looking assignment x[2] <- 12 is actually a reassignment.

rbind(1,z)

# We can delete rows and columns by reassignment too

# HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS
# In a statistical context, a typical matrix in R has rows corresponding to observations, say on various people, and columns corresponding to variables, such as weight and blood pressure. The matrix is then a two-dimensional data structure. But suppose we also have data taken at different times, one data point per person per variable per time. Time then becomes the third dimension, in addition to rows and columns. In R, such data sets are c
# Example 3 students marks in 2 subject in two test
firsttest <- matrix(c(46,21,50,30,25,50), nrow = 3)
firsttest
secondtest <- matrix(c(46,41,50,43,35,50), nrow = 3)

# In contrast to a vector, in which all elements must be of the same mode, R's list structure can combine objects of different types.
# Vectors which we used so far were ordinary vector also known as atomic vector(components cannot be broken), while list is a recursive vector.

# On an intuitive level, a data frame is like a matrix, with a two-dimensional rows and columns structure. However, it differs from a matrix in that each column may have a different mode. For instance, one column may consist of numbers, and another column might have character strings. In this sense, just as lists are the heterogeneous analogs of vectors in one dimension, data frames are the heterogeneous analogs of matrices for two-dimensional data.
